# CSS variables for themes polyfill

**Warning:** It is not a full featured polyfill for CSS variables. It is just cover the case of flat variables (no nesting).

Moreover, the name of global object with map for CSS variables is hardcoded.

## How to install
- `npm i css-themes-polyfill -S` install as a dependency

## How it works
**Requirement:** The polyfill expect to have global object with a name `TravixTheme` with values for variables.

The script will check all `<link>` tags with data attribute `data-cssvars` and will process them with CSS variables mapping.

It also add an event listener for `DOMSubtreeModified` and when new style tag added it will map its content as well.

There is a global function `cssThemeService` which you can use when you need to map CSS variables with Travix theme.

## Usage
Add it to your main bundle before any dynamically styles tags added.

Preferably add this code only for target platforms: IE11, Edge 14 and Android 4.x




## Development

#### Testing

- `npm run test` to run unit test
- `npm run lint` to check ES-lint errors

#### Requirements
Since there is no transpiling step your code must be compatible with IE11
